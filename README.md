# Programming and Scripting - Project

This repository is my collection of work from the project as part of Programing and Scripting, Spring 2022.
The work in this repository is my own, and was completed as part of my programming and scripting module. 

## Description
In this data analysis we will be examining the relationship between the dimentions of the petals and septals for the Iris plant as a whole and for each of the 3 flower classes.

### Description of the Iris Database
This program is used to analyis Fisher's Iris Database. This database details 150 Iris flowers, split evenly into 3 sub species of Iris flower, Iris Setosa, Iris Versicolour & Iris Virginica. The database details 4 attributes for each flower, sepal length (cm), sepal width (cm), petal length (cm) & petal width (cm).

Sepals and Petals are found on flowering plants. I would think an petal is easy for all to visualise, this is the flowering leaf of a plant which may have adopted attracting colours to distinguish itself, such as the red rose petals or the yellow sunflower petals. The Sepal again is a part uniquie to flowering plants, the role of the sepal is to protect the delicate flowering petals until:
  1. the plant is mature enought to flower.
  2. the enviornmental conditions are sufficent for the plant to flower
Think of flowering plants with a bud ready to burst to life with petals, the protective shell you see is made of these sepals. When the time comes and the flower opens to reveal the petals, the sepals pull back to allow the petals to open fully.

## Investigation into database




## Getting Started

### Executing program
the analysis.py program requires data from the iris.data database. This data base is availabe at: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/iris. To use this database with the analysis.py program, the database should be saved in a folder titled "data", making the file path from the program "data\iris.data".

Secondly folders must be created for the outputs. A folder must be created titled "Outputs" and 3 sub folders will be created within the Outputs folder. These are 1. "TextSummary" 2. "Histograms" 3. "ScatterPlots". This makes the 3 file paths as "Outputs\TextSummary\" "Outputs\Histograms\" "Outputs\ScatterPlots\", when the program is run, these folders will be populated with the associated data.
